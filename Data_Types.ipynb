        "### **Data Types Introduction**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **What are Data Types?**\n",
        "    - In computer science, a data type is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable can hold. Think of it as a label for the kind of data (e.g., numbers, texts, true/false values) we're dealing with.\n",
        "    - For instance, if we label something as a 'text' type, it means the variable will hold textual information like names, addresses, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Why Do We Need Different Data Types?**\n",
        "1. **Efficiency:** Different data types use different amounts of memory. By choosing the right data type, we ensure our programs run efficiently.\n",
        "2. **Precision:** Some tasks require precision. For instance, financial calculations might need decimal values instead of whole numbers.\n",
        "3. **Clarity:** Using the right data type makes the code more readable and understandable.\n",
        "4. **Error Prevention:** Certain operations are only valid for specific data types. Having the right type can prevent errors. For example, you wouldn't want to accidentally add someone's name to their age.\n",

        "### **Integers and Floats**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Definition and Examples of Integers and Floats**\n",
        "- **Integers:**\n",
        "    - These are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero. They do not have decimal points.\n",
        "    - Examples: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n",
        "- **Floats:**\n",
        "    - Also known as floating-point numbers, these are numbers that have a decimal point.\n",
        "    - They can represent real numbers (both rational and irrational numbers).\n",
        "    - Examples: -3.5, 0.0, 2.71, 3.14, ...\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **The Difference Between the Two**\n",
        "1. **Representation:** Integers are whole numbers without a decimal point, while floats have a decimal point.\n",
        "2. **Memory:** Floats typically require more memory than integers due to the precision they carry.\n",
        "3. **Operations:** Some operations might yield different results. For instance, dividing two integers might truncate the result, whereas dividing two floats will retain the decimal portion.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Practice: Create Variables of Integer and Float Types and Perform Basic Arithmetic Operations**\n",
        "1. **Creating Variables:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "int_variable = 5\n",
        "float_variable = 5.5\n",
        "```\n",
        "2. **Arithmetic Operations:**\n",
        "    - **Addition:** `int_variable + 3` will result in `8`, but `float_variable + 3` will result in `8.5`.\n",
        "    - **Division:** `int_variable / 2` might differ in some languages in its result compared to `float_variable / 2`. In Python 3, both will return a float, but in some languages, integer division truncates the result.\n",
        "    - **Multiplication:** `int_variable * 2` will result in `10`, and `float_variable * 2` will result in `11.0`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Experimentation:** Create your own integer and float variables and experiment with various arithmetic operations to observe the outcomes.\n",
